# How to Run The Program 
**Step 1:**
Download all files
This includes downloading the MM.cpp and the in1.txt file. The in1.txt file must include the amount of processes, the id of the processes, the arrival times, the lifetimes, the number of memory we need to sum, and the memory sums.

**Step 2:**
Compile and Run
Since this is a cpp file, we need to compile using the g++. We will then run it, and we will input an integer for the Memory Size and input a number from 1 to 3 for one of the selected Page Sizes.

**Step 3:**
Check Output 
We will now check our files and select the newly created file named MM_output.txt. This will show the full output and the turnaround time.
